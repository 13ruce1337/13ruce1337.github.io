      Born in Wilmington, DE I gravitated towards music and technology. Needless to say, I joined every band possible in school. Now I am proficient at playing Saxophone, Flute, Piano, Drums, and Bass Guitar (with a little Guitar). When I wasn't in school, I was hacking together some sort of computer, finding pieces anywhere and everywhere. By 12 I had built my first computer. At some point in high school I stumbled upon Fruity Loops, now known as FL Studio. It was the marriage of the two obsessions. At this point I decided to go to Berklee College of Music for Music Production and Engineering. Finishing up there I continued to freelance as an audio engineer and worked with many different artists around the US. More recently I added software and web development to my technology obsession. Some of my application and audio work can be found here on my site. Thanks for visiting!
