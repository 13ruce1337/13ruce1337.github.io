This little beast runs Chrome OS navitely which is a high underrated OS. If you took a minute to think about what exactly you do on your computer, you will realize that you spend around 80% of it in a web browser. There are some that do work in programs like Photo Shop, Pro Tools, Final Cut, etc. but this little guy isn't built to be your workhorse. He is built to get you to the internet FAST. Here are some basic specs:

Pros
-
- Battery life is actually ~8.5 hours. I attribute it to the fact that it isn't constantly running a bunch of unnecessary programs that you don't need. Like I said, get to the internet FAST
- Speakers are actually ok for being super small. I haven't done a frequency response test but I can definitley say that as an audio engineer, I was impressed from what came out. Just don't expect Yamaha or Genelec quality.
- Quiet as a mouse. There is only one fan inside and it only runs every once and a while.
- Super light weight. Since it's only 11", I can fit it in most bag compartments and not notice it's in there.
- +1 for Linux
- Screen brightness is never a problem. The screen isn't glossed over with glass giving it its natural matt feel.
- If it is off, and you open it, it will turn itself on.
- To turn it off, just press and hold the button. It turns off in seconds.
- Function keys (ex F1, F2) double as awesome shortcuts labelled by the keys
- Google gives you 2 years of 100GB in Google Drive
- It was just $199...

Cons
-
- Limited memory
- Very occasionally crashes (remember its a new idea being developed)
- Limited to Chrome App store to download applications
- You must use google chrome browser
- Not much to do if you don't have internet

<br/>

That being said, you can clean up the last few cons by installing Linux on the machine. There are multiple ways to install it. I've chosen to use [Chrubuntu](http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/764181-how-to-install-linux-on-an-acer-c720-chromebook) as seen below. If you just need an internet machine, this is the one to get. It's currently blowing the competition out of the water in terms of its class at 2GB RAM and 16GB SSD.
