<h2>WCS: 2014 Season 2 Challenger</h2>
<div class='subtitle'>
<strong>Games this week</strong><br/>
Monday Minigun vs QXC (AM) 5/12 @6pm EDT<br/>
Tuesday Group A (EU) 5/13 @12pm EDT<br/>
Thursday Group B (EU) 5/15 @12pm EDT

Wasn't able to catch all the games. Results can be found [here](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/2014_WCS_Season_2_America/Challenger). I am very surprised by the Jaedong and Nony match. I believe Nony is no longer willing to spend the time on the game. Dong basically exhausted him game 2 by letting the game ride out for over an hour with swarm hosts. This seems to be all the rage in zerg right now. I'm sure this meta will be nerfed soon. NesTea is one of my favorite zergs since I began watching SCII years ago. He has fallen by the way side a bit but he is still one of the most successful and arguably the best. He almost let all his games go, but he reverse all killed iaguz(new player for Root). GGs, but as Roti said, this may be one of the longest nights for WCS challenger series.

<h2>GSL: 2014 Season 2</h2>
<div class='subtitle'>
<strong>Games this week</strong><br/>
Wednesday Group E (KR) 5/14 @5am EDT<br/>
Friday Group F (KR) 5/16 @5am EDT<br/>

I wasn't too far off from my initial predictions. Rain is at 2-0 and Stork took 2-1. Symbol somehow found his way to the bottom of the pool. Life is a beast, and takes his group 2-0. How ever I didn't not catch the games so I'm not sure how Hydra fell to Classic twice. SK T1 all day. I predict Maru then DRG for group E. For group F, it's hard to say. PartinG and SuperNova are both unbelievably good. I'd put PartinG first, then SuperNova.

<h2>LCS</h2>
Amazing allstars matches. SKT1 too strong in every esport. Clean sweep in the finals vs OMG. There were a lot of awesome challenge matches giving some players the chance to play their champs that made them famous. I was unable to watch most of them because they were aired first in the afternoon of CEST (Held in Paris, France). Results can be found [here](http://lol.gamepedia.com/All-Star_2014). The [Stick Figure Spotlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMJo3vaijx4) was amazing as always. This is one of my favorite editions to this esport.
5/23 the summer split will begin.

<h2>OGN</h2>
This week we have the 3rd/4th place match on 5/16(Friday) @6am EDT between SG Ozone and CJ Blaze. Finals still slated for 5/24.
