This simple application is a basic countdown timer that can be used as a stand alone application or an API for your webpage. Check out the git [here](https://github.com/13ruce1337/tymr).

<br/>

Checkout Tymr [here]({{site.base}}/tymr) if you are already on the web and just need a quick timer.

*if you want to download it, `right click` it then click `save as`*

<br/>

The API is pretty straight forward. You will need jquery called in a script tag above the call for the API script tag. The global object Tymr houses the functions that start and stop the timer via `Tymr.start()` and `Tymr.stop()`. The other dependency is you must have 3 inputs with corresponding classes `tymr_hour`, `tymr_minute`, `tymr_second`. These inputs will serve as the clock. After that, style the page, including the buttons and inputs, as you please.
