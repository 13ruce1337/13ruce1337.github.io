Completely new to this. I have had a lot of experience with templating engines and the back end environment but I have never used a CMS this powerful before. Jekyll has a lot to offer and I do, so far, recommend it to anyone that has to create a quick static site/blog.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on Jekyll.
