BPM stands for beats per minute. In the music industry, most engineers and producers understand this term. This little app allows you to click your desired tempo while it logs your BPM.

<br/>

If you are a front end developer, you could fork it [here](https://github.com/13ruce1337/BPM) or you could include:

<br/>

`<script src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/13ruce1337/BPM/master/build/bpm.min.js'></script>`

<br/>

after [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) and use `BPM.init()` on a button. You will also want to add the class `BPM` to an element to display the current BPM. If you would like to utilize the previous BPM add the class `BPM_prev` to an element.

<br/>

Gotta love the simple apps.

<br/>

Checkout BPM [here]({{site.base}}/bpm).
