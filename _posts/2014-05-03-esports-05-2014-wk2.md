  Things have died down a bit since the major LCS tournaments have finished, but things are just beginning for the spring and summer events. Take off your down coats and grab your Ray-Bans and a mojitos folks. Things are warming up.

<h2>DreamHack Open: Bucharest 2014</h2>
<div class='subtitle'>
<a href='http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/2014_DreamHack_Open/Bucharest)'>Results</a><br/>
1st - <strong>Life</strong> * 2nd - <strong>Impact</strong> * 3rd - <strong>Jaedong</strong>
</div>
<br/>

I know I'm a tad late with these results but I would like to just touch on them a bit. Some notables that got dropped during group stage include: Mana, MorroW, HerO, and Huk. The finals weren't much of a final as Impact got swept by Life 3-0.

<h2>Lone Star Clash 3</h2>
<div class='subtitle'>
<a href='http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Lone_Star_Clash_3'>Results</a><br/>
1st - <strong>Jaedong</strong> * 2nd - <strong>Polt</strong> * 3rd - <strong>Bomber</strong>
</div>
<br/>

Held down in Texas, the unit of the weekend was "Swarm Host". Probably one of the most intense Z v Z battles I've seen between Stephano, the reigning champ of the last 2 Lone Stars, and Petraeus. For a moment during game 2 I thought I was going to witness the longest match in SCII history clocking over the Firecake and Mana game. Casters included Incontrol, Axeltoss, and Rotterdam. The B stream was there for a bit with Sheth and Destiny. At one point Incontrol states "DT's, a decade of bringing tears to terrans faces". Despite the technical difficulties at the end of the grand finals, the competition was amazing.

<h2>WCS 2014 Season 2</h2>
<div class='subtitle'>
<strong>Games this week</strong><br/>
Tuesday 5/6 @6pm EST<br/>
Wednesday 5/7 @6pm EST
</div>
<br/>

The next few games this week for WCS will be for the challenger series. There are a handful of notable players in this group that once shined at the top including: NesTea, Illusion, SelecT, and viOLet(the list can be found [here](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/2014_WCS_Season_2_America/Challenger)). I am really interested to see what NesTea will do as he is one of the triple OG SCII players. With the meta always changing, it's interesting to see how older players in the game adapt.

<br/>

<h2>GSL: 2014 Season 2</h2>
<div class='subtitle'>
<strong>Games this week</strong><br/>
Wednesday Group C 5/7 @5am EST<br/>
Friday Group D 5/9 @5am EST
</div>
<br/>

Its hard to keep up with the GSL seeing as how it's aired when most of the US is sleeping. With that, so far the group stages look like this, in order from first in the group to last: Group A - Zest, Dark, Bbyong, tAilS, Group B - TRUE, SoO, Trap, RagnaroK. My predictions for group c is that Symbol is as the top with 2-0 follwed by Rain at 2-1. Predictions for group d will be Life on top at 2-0 and Hydra second at 2-1.

Ok...now onto a brighter note, the All Star game!
It will be in Paris, France this year from 5/8(Thurs) - 5/11(Sun) at Le Zenith Arena. There will be a new format encompassing more gameplay between the best players from all regions. Voting is finished and results can be found [here](http://na.lolesports.com/).
